import numpy as np

print('a')
# x + y -10w = -9   => x = 10w -9 - y
# z - 7w = -7       => z = 7w - 7
# Answer:
# x = 10t - 9 - s
# z = 7t - 7
# y = s
# w = t

print('b')
# x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + 2x5 = 0
# x5 = 0
# Answer:
# x1 = -a - b - c
# x2 = a
# x3 = b
# x4 = c
# x5 = 0
# x6 = d

print('c')
# x1 + 3x2 + 6x5 + 2x6 = 2
# x3 + 3x5 = 1
# x4 = 0
# Answer:
# x1 = 2 - 3a - 6b - 2c
# x2 = a
# x3 = 1 - 3b
# x4 = 0
# x5 = b
# x6 = c
